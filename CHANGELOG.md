# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versions track the Spider API contract:
the `major.minor` mirror the contract version and the trailing number is the SDK patch.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `maxTransfers` now maps to the router's boarding count (`maximumTransfers = transfers + 1`). The
  router indexes legs with leg 0 as the initial access (walk, or nothing), so passing the caller's
  transfer count verbatim made `maxTransfers` 0 and 1 behave identically. Now `0` means direct,
  `1` allows one transfer, and so on.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-22

Initial public pre-release; targets Spider API contract 0.1.

**Stability:** this is a pre-1.0 release. While the version stays below `1.0.0`, any `0.x` minor
bump may introduce breaking changes to the public API. Pin an exact version and review the
changelog before upgrading.

### Covered surfaces

- **Trip planning** — multi-leg journeys via `planConnection`.
- **Stop departures** — upcoming departures for a stop, combining static schedule and realtime delays.
- **Single-trip lookup** — the stops and times of one trip.
- **Stop search** — text/autocomplete and geographic (nearest / bounding-box / radius) stop queries.
- **Realtime** — live vehicle positions, delays, and service alerts.
